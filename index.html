          >Mark Passio is an anarchist, independent researcher, public speaker,
          radio talk show host, conference organizer, and freedom activist from
          Philadelphia, PA. Mark has undertaken the task of assembling vast
          amounts of research in the areas of metaphysics, occultism,
          spirituality, symbology and consciousness studies. In 2007, Mark began
          presenting this information in the form of a presentation series
          entitled What On Earth Is Happening, with the intention of bringing
          the implications of this body of knowledge to greater public
          awareness. Mark launched his own web site in 2008 at
          WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com. In 2010, Mark began hosting his own
          internet radio show, also called What On Earth Is Happening, which has
          over 230 episodes to date. Mark was one of the co-founders of the Free
          Your Mind Conference, the Philadelphia-based conference on
          consciousness, mind control and the occult. Mark has taught intensive
          live seminars, including Natural Law: The Real Law Of Attraction & How
          To Apply It In Your Life, New Age B.S. & The Suppression Of The Sacred
          Masculine, Street-Wise Spirituality, and De-Mystifying The Occult.
          Over the years, Mark has worked closely with activist groups in his
          area such as the Tesla Science Foundation, Truth-Freedom-Prosperity
          and Survive & Thrive Philadelphia. Mark also is the founding member
          and lead vocalist of the Philadelphia-based anarchist hardcore-punk
          band, The Founders. Mark's most recent project is the One Great Work
          Network, a privately-organized collective of Conscious Individuals,
          who each create dynamic content for the purpose of spreading the
          message of Natural Law, Truth, and Freedom to a worldwide audience.</i
